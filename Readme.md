Project: Create a web service to act as a personal travel assistant, giving information about travel and weather. 

This  web service gives the information about the weather of a specific place based on the name of the place or zip code. The WorldWeatherOnline API is used to get the weather information.

The second tab gives information about travel options from one location to other. Rome2Rio API is used for fetching this information.
